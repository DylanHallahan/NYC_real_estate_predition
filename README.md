# NYC_Price_Predition
This project showcases skills with the following tools.

1. Jupyter Notebooks, Pycharm and VS Studio for IDE
2. Beautifulsoup for web scraping
3. Pandas, Numby, and Seaborn for data exploration and cleaning
4. SciKit Learn for model building
5. Flask for model storage
6. CSS, JS and HTML for app development

The goal for this project is to create a model and deploy that could add value to a real estate company. Giving a tool such as this could help a real estate investment company when determining property value for the size and location of a particular property. This model could be expanded to predict expected rent and could incorporate an expected ROI for a property.
